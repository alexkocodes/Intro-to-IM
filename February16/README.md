## How It Works

This program generates a confusing but hilarious poem every time you click the screen. I loaded a csv files that containes a bunch of random verbs, bodyparts, places, celebrity names, etc, and put them into a poem format string. I used noLoop() and loop() to generate one poem each click. 


## Difficulties

  ### Finding the correct columns in the CSV file.
   
  I realized I had to use the function getStringColumn to load a whole column by its header name, which is a little bit different than what we do in C++ (but more convenient).

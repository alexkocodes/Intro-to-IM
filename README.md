I have always loved avatar since I was a kid. Therefore, I want to make a self portrait based on my favorite TV character! 

One difficulty that I faced is drawing the nose. Since I was using the curve function, I had a hard time finding the correct positions. But at the end I still managed to draw something that I like.

# Processing & Arduiono: Serial Communication 
## How it works
I built my program based on the [gravity example](https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/arduinoExamples/serialExamples/buildOffThisOne/buildOffThisOne.ino) provided in class, and with the following modifications:
1. When the ball hits the ground, one of the four LEDs will light up. 
2. Use the potentiometer to move the hand. 
3. Press the blank key to drop a ball from the hand.
4. Use the left and right arrow key as wind to blow the ball. 
5. The floor is divided into four different color areas: green, yellow, blue, and red from left to right. When the ball hits the floor, the light with the corresponding color will light up, even when you use the wind to blow the ball.

## Interesting things I discovered...
### Potentiometer value changed when one of the LED lights up.

## For Loop

### How it works
I used for loop to create this interactive program, where the color changes when you click on the window. I also used the functions random to create random colors on each circle. 

### Difficulties
I realized that when I used circle(), the circle is filled with white area. Therefore, when I first tried to draw the circle from the inner to outer layer, it only showed the biggest circle. Because each time the white area covers the previous circle wholly. A simple noFill() fixed this problem.

# Flappy Bird - Arduino + Processing by Alex Ko 
## April 19th 
After a few days of thinking, I have decided to change my game. I will be making a flappy bird game (below for inspiration) by using arduino and processing. I plan to use the __LDR sensor__ to detect whether the user has clicked the sensor or not.

### Goal for today: 
Wired up the LDR and make sure the bird will go up and down based on the finger. 
### Progress: 
I managed to complete my goal and added some modifications so that the bird won't go out of the screen. Below is a demonstration of what I have done today.

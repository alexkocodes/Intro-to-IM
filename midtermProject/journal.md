Since I have created this game in python before, I spent about one day familiarizing myself with the syntax difference between java and python. I plan to create the first page and test whether I can use the same code structure I used in python now in java, especially buttons. My game has about 11 questions and therefore 11 code blocks, each of which has its own unique structure and therefore I need to write about 11 differnet structures. Nonetheless this is the preliminary starting page.

### Goal: reach question6
### Status: success. 
I have finished all the questions until question 9. Here are the results. Might need to adjust some some font sizes when the mouse hovers over the options. Found a more efficient way to do question 6 when the user drags the image. So far I have written about 516 lines of code.

### Goal: finsih the whole game
### Status: success. 
I finsihed coding the whole game. I also finished writing the code for the coin class, lives class, win or gameover pages as well. I have successfully translated about 680 lines of python code to Java, which now has about 690 lines of code.

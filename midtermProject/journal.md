Since I have created this game in python before, I spent about one day familiarizing myself with the syntax difference between java and python. I plan to create the first page and test whether I can use the same code structure I used in python now in java, especially buttons. My game has about 11 questions and therefore 11 code blocks, each of which has its own unique structure and therefore I need to write about 11 differnet structures. Nonetheless this is the preliminary starting page.
